## 📘 **Overview**

**AITL Silicon Pathway** is an educational project that systematically explores how the AITL control architecture  
(**PID × FSM × LLM**) can be implemented and studied along a complete “pathway to silicon”:

**Python → Verilog (RTL) → OpenLane → GDSII → SPICE (ngspice)**

The objective is to connect control engineering, digital circuit design, semiconductor physical design,  
and AI-driven modeling into one coherent learning framework.

## 📚 **Chapter Structure**

### **Chapter 1: AITL Control Architecture in Python**  
Implement the three-layer AITL architecture—PID, FSM, and LLM—in Python to build a foundation for hybrid control systems.

### **Chapter 2: RTL Conversion of the FSM (Verilog)**  
Translate the Python-based FSM into synthesizable Verilog RTL and learn practical principles of hardware state machine design.

### **Chapter 3: From RTL to ASIC (OpenLane)**  
Use OpenLane for logic synthesis, floorplanning, placement & routing, and generate a GDSII layout suitable for fabrication.

### **Chapter 4: Layout Extraction (Magic)**  
Perform parasitic (RC) extraction and generate an extracted SPICE netlist directly from the physical layout.

### **Chapter 5: Waveform & Timing Analysis (ngspice)**  
Simulate the extracted netlist in ngspice to analyze real physical effects such as delay, waveform behavior, and power consumption.
