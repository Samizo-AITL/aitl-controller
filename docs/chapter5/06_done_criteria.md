# 5.6 Done Criteria

Chapter5 is complete when:

- [ ] All Chapter4 invariants have executable checks
- [ ] Assertions fire on injected bugs
- [ ] Python ↔ Verilog traces match
- [ ] Fault paths are exercised
- [ ] Reset behavior is verified

If all pass:
> FSM correctness is not only claimed, but exercised.
